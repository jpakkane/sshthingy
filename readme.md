# Unnamed SSH client

This repository contains a simple SSH client using [libssh](https://www.libssh.org/) and [libvte](https://git.gnome.org/browse/vte/).

It's rough and not suitable for actual usage, but it has the following feature:

 - connect with password or SSH keys
 - forward SSH port forwards (not reverse forwards)
 - browse, download and upload files via sftp
 - no threads
